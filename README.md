Welcome to our project that explores managing datasets that would be required to build a species distribution model (SDM). We have spatially restricted ourselevs to terrestrial Costa Rica. Our aim is to harmonize a bunch of datasets to the same spatial grids, such that they could be fed into a model that would then predict the some biodiversity indicator, such as species richness or Simpson's Biodiversity Index, etc.

This project was entirely developed on [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) (MPC) and the code provided here will work as-is on an MPC Hub. We have used **dask** and **dask_geopandas** extensively to parallelize computation and ease of development, and use geopandas, numpy and xarray datastructures throughout. We would like to thank the MPC team for providing student researchers with these great resources, including the datasets.

## Main Files

The following is a decription of all the notebooks relevant to this project. We were able to wrangle only the HFI, Terra Climate and GBIF datasets for this project. However, this framework should be infinitely extensible for any other datasets relevant to building an SDM, restricted to some preordained geography. Please find the process details in each module listed below:

1. [Main](scripts/main.ipynb) / [NB Viewer Main](https://nbviewer.org/github/espm-288/final-project-team-ando-shravan-final_proj/blob/master/scripts/main.ipynb) - Harmonizes the outputs of all the datasets and we underscore some GBIF insights along with correlation and spatial autocorrelation analyses.

2. [GBIF Module](scripts/gbif.ipynb) / [NB Viewer GBIF](https://nbviewer.org/github/espm-288/final-project-team-ando-shravan-final_proj/blob/master/scripts/gbif.ipynb)- The Global Biodiversity Information Facility - provides this open source dataset with geolocated species taxonomic observations worldwide. Here we parse the data relevant to terrestrial Costa Rica.

3. [HFI Module](scripts/hfi.ipynb) / [NB Viewer HFI](https://nbviewer.org/github/espm-288/final-project-team-ando-shravan-final_proj/blob/master/scripts/hfi.ipynb) - The Human Footprint Index is an extensively used tool for interpreting the accelerating pressure of humanity on Earth. We use the dataset provided by Patrick W Keys et al., as one of the predictors of biodiversity. Details within the notebook

4. [Terra Climate Module](scripts/terra.ipynb) / [NB Viewer Terra](https://nbviewer.org/github/espm-288/final-project-team-ando-shravan-final_proj/blob/master/scripts/terra.ipynb) - We process Terra Climate's dataset here and extract and reproject all terra climate data variables (such as temperature, precipitation, soil moisture etc.) from a 4km to 0.00989273 degree grids. Details within notebook

#### Alternative Renders
In case the .ipynb files do not render on Github, you can also view the same on Jupyter's Nbviewer links above


## ToDos (Archived):

### General

- [x] Emable Github pages
- [x] Create a single notebook that calls functions for each of the modules
- [x] Grid the outputs of each module to the same grids
- [x] Final output is a geopandas frame with each column as a different feature
- [x] Correlation and spatial autocorrelation analysis
- [x] Other insights


### GBIF
- [x] Parse the GBIF stac, reduce to terrestrial Costa Rica (CR)
- [x] Gridify to some cuztomizable parameter (such as 0.01 deg lat/lon)
- [x] Work with Dask and Dask-Geopandas to parallelize processing
- [x] Establish Planetary computer workflow
- [x] Output to a rectangular geopandas dataframe
- [ ] Output to raster - GeoTIFF (geoCube did not work)
- [x] Use groupby on lat/lon to get individual count and number of observations per grid in the final output
- [x] Use dask and dask_geopandas to speed up operations

### Terra
- [x] Define and document variables of interest
