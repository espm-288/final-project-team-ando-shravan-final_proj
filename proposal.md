# Final project proposal: Feature Engineering for species distribution model using deep learning


Please prepare a short proposal on your final project idea here. The proposal should include:


- Title & description of the project
Team members: Ando Shah (@ando-shah) and Shravan Kumar Undaru (@undaru96)
- A description of the data required, and how it will be obtained (e.g. URL/DOI to data source)
- Our analysis will explore variation of species distribution* in Costa Rica across:
	- the number of occurance in GBIF
	- Human modification index / Human footprint index
	- Biomass
	- Climate (terra for max temp, min temp, avg humidity)
	- Landcover type

*species distribution is defined as the number of unique species in a ROI (region of interest)
