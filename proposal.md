# Feature Engineering for species distribution model


Please prepare a short proposal on your final project idea here. The proposal should include:


Team members: Ando Shah (@ando-shah) and Shravan Kumar Undaru (@undaru96)
Objective: Pre-processing (Data cleaning, de-biasing and feature engineering) of spatial datasets (GBIF, HMI, HFI, Climate etc.) to feed a deep learning model for predicting count of unique species
- Our analysis will explore variation of count of unique species in across:
	- the number of occurance in GBIF
	- Human modification index / Human footprint index
	- Biomass
	- Climate (terra for max temp, min temp, avg humidity)
	- Landcover type

Scope for the project is limited using following considerations:
	- Geographic: Costa Rica
	- Taxonomic: In consideration (inclined to remove birds due to citizen science oversampling) 
	- Temporal: All time

Motivation: Our observation that GBIF has a lot of sampling bias particularly in the global south. Our aim is to accurately predict the count of unique species in areas with fewer observations.
